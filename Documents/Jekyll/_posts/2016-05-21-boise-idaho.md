I've lived near Boise, Idaho for the past few years. It's a good place to be. Plenty of
stuff around but not too busy. I like that it's easy to get away from it all. A short
drive can get you to open fields, desert, forest, mountains, and more.

I hope to stay aorund for a long time. There is still so much of Idaho that I haven't
seen!
