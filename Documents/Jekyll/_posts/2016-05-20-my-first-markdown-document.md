Check it out, I'm writing in *Markdown*.

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a special syntax used for quickly writing webcontent without getting bogged 
down with all the mark-up of HTML.

## Why write in Markdown?

* It's concise
* It let's you focus on the content instead of the code
* You can house all your documents right on your computer and serve it to GitHub.

# But let me back up...

I've jumped right into this, but I really should introduce myself. I'm Eric. I've had a bit
of a late start getting into coding, development, etc. I'm not really fully into it
yet, but I'm trying to get there.
